RUNNING AND COMPILING:

    To compile: open up a terminal, move to the directory where the folder "holes"
    is located (they should be all located in the same directory) or wherever 
    the decompressed tar "dine.tar.gz is located and type 'make'. 

    To run: type './holes' into that same directory, and then enter the name of
    the text file as an argument that you wish to read the process information in from. 
    
    Used sequential circular arrays for queue types, and an int array to
    simulate the slots in memory.
